##About
This repo is just a future reference for myself.  The base of the code is from [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/) by Scott Murray.

Prior to reading this, I had been introduced to d3 from the teamTreehouse course.  I had wanted to become more proficient with d3.js but it got pushed to the side.  I came across this book on a code challenge for a job.  Even if I didn't get the job, I did get an interesting challenge and I found a great reference.

most git commits will reference the chapter from said tutorial
